#
# Setup kubernetes on AWS with EC2 instances using Ansible
#


# Step 1:
Create multiple EC2 instances
Make sure they can communicate between each other (Check security group: All traffic should be allowed for the group)

# Step 2:
When you had created your instances, you need to update the `host` file
- set the IPs to the nodes
- set the correct path to the rsa key

# Step 3:
Run the following commands to deploy the kubernetes cluster
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
ansible-playbook -i hosts setup.yml
ansible-playbook -i hosts master.yml
ansible-playbook -i hosts slaves.yml


## NOTES:
By default master is not considered as a pod, if you want it to be one, rune the following command
kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-




# Commands to test the cluster for a replica set of mongo db (files present in the ./mongodb folder)
